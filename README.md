## We need your support
This software is provided as Free and Open Source Software, and we are happy if you find it useful. However, we have put a lot of work into it (and continue to do so), much of it unpaid for. So if you benefit from our software, please consider making a financial contribution so we can continue to maintain and develop it further.

If you are willing to support us in developing this tool, please send an email to info@systopia.de to get an invoice or agree a different payment method. Thank you!
